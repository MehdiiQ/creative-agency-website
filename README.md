## 📋 About this Project

This project is a landing page designed for creative agencies. It includes a video hero section that grabs attention right away.

Key features include:

- A full-screen video background on the top section  
- An interactive grid listing agency services  
- A portfolio section highlighting previous projects  
- Animations that activate when you scroll to certain sections  
- A mobile-friendly menu for easy access on handheld devices  

The project uses simple HTML, CSS with animations, and vanilla JavaScript. It avoids complex setups, making it easy to run on any modern web browser.

## 🔧 How to Use the Website

Once open in your browser, explore these sections:

- **Hero Section:** Watch the video background that loops automatically. This is the main attention grabber.  
- **Service Grid:** Hover or tap on each service block to see details or animations pop up.  
- **Portfolio:** Scroll through past work examples with clickable previews.  
- **Animations:** Scroll down the page and watch different sections fade in or slide as you reach them.  
- **Mobile Menu:** On small screens, tap the menu icon (three bars) to open navigation links.

You can refresh the page anytime to restart the animations. No additional controls or settings are needed.

## 🛠️ Customization

If you want to customize the landing page:

- Open the `index.html` file in a plain text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).  
- The HTML file contains the structure of the page. Text and links can be changed here.  
- CSS files control colors, layout, and animations. They live in a `css` folder or similar.  
- JavaScript controls interactive effects. It will be in `.js` files in a `js` folder.  
- Replace the example videos or images by uploading your own files and updating the links in the HTML or CSS files.

No special coding skills are needed to change simple text or images. However, advanced style or code adjustments require some experience.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:

- Make sure you have the latest version of your web browser.  
- Verify you opened `index.html` specifically, not just the folder.  
- If the video does not play, confirm your device supports common video formats (MP4 is usually supported).  
- Clear browser cache and reload the page if visual glitches appear.  
- For missing animations or grid interaction, ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.  
- If you cannot unzip the files, try a different extractor app.
